### Charity classification project refactor

Update classification project for machine learning course, originally written in R, to Python 3.

The goal of the project is to maximize the return on investment for a charity's targeted mailing by targeting likely donors.

**To do:**
* Can x_df and c_df creation be captured in a function (DRY)?
* Outlier and influential point detection and management
* Missing value handling
* Adjustments for non-normal distributions in predictors and target
* Logistic regression
* GAM
* LDA (not usually used for qualitative variables, but use anyway as given method to try)
* QDA
* KNN classifier
* Decision tree
* Bagging and random forest
* Boosting
* SVC
* Model results comparison
